Start by running "make depend"

This is a double precision version of the map projections done in
gridpak. These are in C++ and work (today) with g++. In both cases,
edit the .cc file and provide it with the map projection parameters,
then compile.

Coast: provide it with strings of lat,lon pairs, ending in a
special value of 999, 999. See coast.in for example.

Tolat2: give the grid filename as an argument or it will prompt for
it. It will perform the inverse map projections to find the latitude,
longitude values on your gridpoints.
